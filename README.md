### **_Description_**

#### This app will allow users to post timestamped and geo-located photos, making it easier for journalists and the general public to construct comprehensive timelines of news events.

#### When a user posts a photo, they will be able to document the event name, photo description, location, and timestamp. Users can update their photos with more accurate descriptions and delete any inaccurate posts.

#### The photos will be categorized by event name and users can look for photos of different events.

#### A post MVP version will incorporate user authentication so that only the user can update or delete their posts. There will also be a social media component in the post MVP version to discuss news events in a comments section.
